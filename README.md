# Summer of Bitcoin Code Challenge 2021

This repository contains my work on cryptocurrency based problem statement for Summer of Bitcoin 2021.

## The problem

Bitcoin miners construct blocks by selecting a set of transactions from their mempool. Each transaction in the mempool:

- includes a ``` fee ``` which is collected by the miner if that transaction is included in a block
- has a ``` weight ```, which indicates the size of the transaction
- may have one or more ``` parent transactions ``` which are also in the mempool

The miner selects an ordered list of transactions which have a combined weight below the maximum block weight. Transactions with parent transactions in the mempool may be included in the list, but only if all of their parents appear before them in the list.

Naturally, the miner would like to include the transactions that maximize the total fee.

Your task is to write a program which reads a file mempool.csv, with the format:

``` <txid>, <fee>, <weight>, <parent_txids> ```

- ``` txid ``` is the transaction identifier
- ``` fee ``` is the transaction fee
- ``` weight ``` is the transaction weight
- ``` parent_txids ``` is a list of the txids of the transaction’s unconfirmed parent transactions (confirmed parent transactions are not included in this list). It is of the form: <txid1>;<txid2>;...

The output from the program should be txids, separated by newlines, which make a valid block, maximizing the fee to the miner. Transactions **MUST** appear in order (no transaction should appear before one of its parents).

We've included a non-working ``` block_sample.txt ``` file to demonstrate the expected format.
  
## Input file
  
Here are two lines of the ``` mempool.csv ``` file:

``` 2e3da8fbc1eaca8ed9b7c2db9e6545d8ccac3c67deadee95db050e41c1eedfc0,452,1620, ```

This is a transaction with txid ``` 2e3da8... ```, fees of 452 satoshis, weight of 1620, and no parent transactions in the mempool.
  
``` 9d317fb308fd5451fd0ec612165638cb9e37bd8aa8918dff99a48fe05224276f,350,1400,288ea91bb52d8cb28289f4db0d857356622e39e78f33f26bf6df2bbdd3810fad;b5b993bda3c23bdefe4a1cf75b1f7cbdfe43058f2e4e7e25898f449375bb685c;c1ae3a82e52066b670e43116e7bfbcb6fa0abe16088f920060fa41e09715db7d ```
  
This is a transaction with txid ``` 9d317f... ``` , fees of 350 satoshis, weight of 1400 and three parent transactions in the mempool with txids ``` 288ea9.... ``` , ``` b5b993... ``` and ``` c1ae3a... ```


## Parsing the input file
  
Here is some sample Python code to parse the input file. You may use this snippet in your solution if you want:

```
class MempoolTransaction():
  def __init__(self, txid, fee, weight, parents):
    self.txid = txid
    self.fee = int(fee)
    # TODO: add code to parse weight and parents fields

def parse_mempool_csv():
  """Parse the CSV file and return a list of MempoolTransactions."""
  with open('mempool.csv') as f:
    return([MempoolTransaction(*line.strip().split(',')) for line in f.readlines()])
```
  
## Hints

- The total weight of transactions in a block must not exceed 4,000,000 weight. For this exercise assume that there is no coinbase transaction.
- A transaction may only appear in a block if all of its parents appear **_earlier_** in the block.

## General Advice

- Spend no more than two to three days on the exercise. The idea is not that you come up with a perfect solution, but that you think about your approach. First, make a naive solution that constructs a valid block, then iterate to improve it.
- We’re most familiar with Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Scheme, Lisp, Ruby, and Elixir and would prefer to receive solutions in those languages. If you’d like to use a different language, please check with us first to make sure we’ll be able to review it!
- You should be able to explain your reasoning, design decisions, and trade-offs.
  
## What to send us

 - the source code for your solution (sending a GitHub repo URL works as well -- you will need to do this if you used JS)
 - the output from running the program with mempool.csv as block.txt .
 - You may optionally also include .git files to show your commit history

# Solution

```
import pandas as pd

max_weight = 4000000
block_weight = 0
block_fee = 0
included_transactions = []
data = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Summer of Bitcoin/mempool.csv'

def allow_tx(id):
  if id == "None":
    return True
  temp_id = id.split(';')

  return (set(temp_id).issubset(set(included_transactions)))

df = pd.read_csv(data)
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='fee', ascending=False)
sorted_df = sorted_df.fillna("None")
sorted_df.reset_index(inplace = True)

for i in range(len(sorted_df)):

  if ( (block_weight + (sorted_df['weight'][i])) <= max_weight ):
    temp_parent = sorted_df.iloc[:, 4][i]

    if (allow_tx(temp_parent)):
      block_weight += sorted_df['weight'][i]
      block_fee += sorted_df['fee'][i]
      included_transactions.append(sorted_df['tx_id'][i])

write_data = []
for i in included_transactions:
  temp = i + "\n"
  write_data.append(temp)

with open("block.txt",'w') as f:
  for line in write_data:
    f.write(line)

from google.colab import files
files.download('block.txt')
```
